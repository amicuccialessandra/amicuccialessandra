## Hi, I'm Alessandra <br/>
_Economics & Policy Evaluation | Data Analysis | Coding for Impact_ <br/>

I'm a Master's student in Economics with hands-on experience in policy evaluation, macroeconomic analysis, and data-driven research. I've worked with institutions like the Kiel Institute, UN (IFAD), and the Italian Ministry of Economy and Finance. <br/>

🔧 I work with R, Python, Stata, and MATLAB to build tools, analyze data, and support research in international economics. <br/>
🌍 Comfortable in multilingual, cross-cultural teams (Italian 🇮🇹, English 🇬🇧, Spanish 🇪🇸). <br/>
📊 I enjoy making complex data clear, reproducible, and policy-relevant. <br/>

_Always curious. Always coding_
